This Cell Culture project is the final project for the "INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON" course (BME387-A)[661821]. The main goal of this project is as follows: the user will upload an image of a cell culture, and my software will count the number of cells. This project was developed in Python using Qt Creator. The cell counting project you see here is designed to be a user-friendly project, free from complexity. The focus has been on ensuring that the processes are quick and that results are easily obtained from these processes.
